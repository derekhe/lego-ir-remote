## Basis

### Basic theory

In order to remotely control a device via IR, you require a transmitter (mobile phone with IR blaster) and a control signal sequence that you want to send. This sequence is the key to the function that the device is supposed to perform (e.g. the function of a TV to turns itself on). The built-in IR receiver of the controlled device analyzes all incoming signals. When they match a pattern of a particular function, the devices calls that function.

The control signal sequence consists of two parameters: The frequency (in _Hertz_) and the pattern, which is a time sequence of _ON_/_OFF_ signals on the specified carrier frequency. Such patterns can be found on the Internet.

### Sequence types

The pattern is pictured by a sequence of numbers either of the hexadecimal (_HEX_) or the decimal (_DEC_) numeral system.

Here's an example:

```
Frequency:
  33000 Hertz (33KHz)
Patterns:
  0) 0x01f4 0x1c84 0x01f4 0x00c8 or (01f4 1c84 01f4 00c8)
  1) 500 7300 500 200
  2) 17 241 17 7
```

The main difference between the patterns in this example is their notation.
Each number in the pattern describes the duration of a single _ON_/_OFF_ signal, only that patterns 0 and 1 describe it in microseconds, while patterns 2 describes it in cycles.

One cycle always consists of an an _ON_ and an _OFF_ signal (the image below shows cycles with a frequency of 40000 _Hz_).

![Difference between sequences](http://s8.postimg.org/s9s4dxumd/91598ad1_1766_469e_8731_99f70f606864.jpg)

### Converting the patterns

The length of a single period _T_ in microseconds equals 1 000 000 (1 second in microseconds) divided by the frequency _f_ (in _Hertz_) 

> _T_ = 1 000 000 _ms_ / _f_

For example

> _T_ = 1 000 000 _ms_/ 33000 _Hz_ â‰ˆ 30.3 _ms_

To covert a microsecond pattern to a cycle pattern, divide each value by _T_

To convert a cycle pattern to a microsecond pattern, simply multiply each value by _T_

## How to use

### 0. Include the InfraRed library to your project

- Download the [AndroidInfraRed](https://github.com/OneButtonDeveloper/AndroidInfraRed) project
- Run the project on a device or an emulator 
- Find the **infrared-release.aar** file in the project folder _(infrared/build/outputs/aar/infrared-release.aar)_
- Import this file into your own project in Android Studio
  _(File > New > New Module... > Import .JAR/.AAR package)_

**Tip!** Your can download the **infrared-release.aar** file from [releases](https://github.com/OneButtonDeveloper/AndroidInfraRed/releases/latest)

**Known issue!** One of the project files contains broken characters. Just rename it again.

### 1. Add the following permissions to your AndroidManifest.xml

```xml
	<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.TRANSMIT_IR" android:required="false"/>
	<uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.consumerir" android:required="false"/>
```
 
### 2. Initialize logging

You can choose between printing your logs to an _EditText_ view ([_LogToEditText_](https://github.com/OneButtonDeveloper/AndroidInfraRed/blob/master/infrared/src/main/java/com/obd/infrared/log/LogToEditText.java)), the _LogCat_ console ([_LogToConsole_](https://github.com/OneButtonDeveloper/AndroidInfraRed/blob/master/infrared/src/main/java/com/obd/infrared/log/LogToConsole.java)) and not logging at all ([_LogToAir_](https://github.com/OneButtonDeveloper/AndroidInfraRed/blob/master/infrared/src/main/java/com/obd/infrared/log/LogToAir.java))

```java
	// print log messages to EditText
	EditText console = (EditText) this.findViewById(R.id.console);
	log = new LogToEditText(console, TAG);

	// print Log messages with Log.d(), Log.w(), Log.e() (LogCat)
	// LogToConsole log = new LogToConsole(TAG);

	// Turn off logs
	// LogToAir log = new LogToAir(TAG);
```
[_LogToEditText_](https://github.com/OneButtonDeveloper/AndroidInfraRed/blob/master/infrared/src/main/java/com/obd/infrared/log/LogToEditText.java) is the default option

### 3. Initialize the [**InfraRed**](https://github.com/OneButtonDeveloper/AndroidInfraRed/blob/master/infrared/src/main/java/com/obd/infrared/InfraRed.java) class

Create a new [_InfraRed_](https://github.com/OneButtonDeveloper/AndroidInfraRed/blob/master/infrared/src/main/java/com/obd/infrared/InfraRed.java) object with the parameters _Context_ and [_Logger_](https://github.com/OneButtonDeveloper/AndroidInfraRed/blob/master/infrared/src/main/java/com/obd/infrared/log/Logger.java)

```java
	infraRed = new InfraRed(this, log);
```

### 4. Initialize the transmitter

```java
	TransmitterType transmitterType = infraRed.detect();

	// initialize transmitter by type
	infraRed.createTransmitter(transmitterType);
```

The "detect()" method returns the [_TransmitterType_](https://github.com/OneButtonDeveloper/AndroidInfraRed/blob/master/infrared/src/main/java/com/obd/infrared/transmit/TransmitterType.java). Possible values:  

* Actual - The signals will be transmitted by the ConsumerIrManager  
* Obsolete - The signals will be transmitted by a Samsung IR service
* HTC - The signals will be transmitted by the HTC IR SDK
* LG, LG_WithOutDevice - The signals will be transmitted by the QRemote SDK
* Undefined - the "empty" implementation will be used to transmitt the signals

### 5. Initialize the raw patterns

```java
	// initialize raw patterns
	List<PatternConverter> rawPatterns = new ArrayList<>();
	// Canon
	// rawPatterns.add(new PatternConverter(PatternType.Intervals, 33000, 500, 7300, 500, 200));
	// Nikon D7100 v.1
	rawPatterns.add(new PatternConverter(PatternType.Cycles, 38400, 1, 105, 5, 1, 75, 1095, 20, 60, 20, 140, 15, 2500, 80, 1));
	// Nikon D7100 v.2
	rawPatterns.add(new PatternConverter(PatternType.Cycles, 38400, 77, 1069, 16, 61, 16, 137, 16, 2427, 77, 1069, 16, 61, 16, 137, 16));
	// Nikon D7100 v.3
	rawPatterns.add(new PatternConverter(PatternType.Intervals, 38000, 2000, 27800, 400, 1600, 400, 3600, 400, 200));
	// Nikon D7100 v.3 fromString
	rawPatterns.add(PatternConverterUtils.fromString(PatternType.Intervals, 38000, "2000, 27800, 400, 1600, 400, 3600, 400, 200"));
	// Nikon D7100 v.3 fromHexString
	rawPatterns.add(PatternConverterUtils.fromHexString(PatternType.Intervals, 38000, "0x7d0 0x6c98 0x190 0x640 0x190 0xe10 0x190 0xc8"));
	// Nikon D7100 v.3 fromHexString without 0x
	rawPatterns.add(PatternConverterUtils.fromHexString(PatternType.Intervals, 38000, "7d0 6c98 190 640 190 e10 190 c8"));
```

The [_PatternConverter_](https://github.com/OneButtonDeveloper/AndroidInfraRed/blob/master/infrared/src/main/java/com/obd/infrared/patterns/PatternConverter.java) can be used to easily define and convert IR patterns between the different patterns types (Cycles and Intervals in ms)

### 6. Adapt the patterns for the device that is used to transmit the patterns

```java
	PatternAdapter patternAdapter = new PatternAdapter(log);
	
	// initialize TransmitInfoArray
	TransmitInfo[] transmitInfoArray = new TransmitInfo[rawPatterns.size()];
	for (int i = 0; i < transmitInfoArray.length; i++) {
	    transmitInfoArray[i] = patternAdapter.createTransmitInfo(rawPatterns.get(i));
	}
	this.patterns = transmitInfoArray;
```

[_PatternAdapter_](https://github.com/OneButtonDeveloper/AndroidInfraRed/blob/master/infrared/src/main/java/com/obd/infrared/patterns/PatternAdapter.java) automatically detects the device's manufacturer (_LG_/_HTC_/_Samsung_) and uses that information to determine how the raw patterns have to be converted in order to be compatible with the transmitter of the used device.

### 7. Implement the start and stop methods

```java
    @Override
    protected void onResume() {
        super.onResume();
        infraRed.start();
    }
   
    @Override
    protected void onDestroy() {
        super.onDestroy();

        infraRed.stop();

        if (log != null) {
            log.destroy();
        }
    }
```

Always call the _start()_ method before transmit IR signals and call the _stop()_ method when you are done.

It is a **good idea** to call them in the _onCreate_/_onDestroy_ or _onResume_/_onPause_ methods.


### 8. Transmit the adapted patterns via IR

```java
    private int currentPattern = 0;

    @Override
    public void onClick(View v) {
        TransmitInfo transmitInfo = patterns[currentPattern++];
        if (currentPattern >= patterns.length) currentPattern = 0;
        infraRed.transmit(transmitInfo);
    }
```

Now we can send IR signals ([_TransmitInfo_](https://github.com/OneButtonDeveloper/AndroidInfraRed/blob/master/infrared/src/main/java/com/obd/infrared/transmit/TransmitInfo.java)) to the device we want to control

### In addition

Examples for the individual steps can be found in this project

- Step 1 in [AndroidManifest.xml](https://github.com/OneButtonDeveloper/AndroidInfraRed/blob/master/infrared/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml)
- Steps 2..8 in [MainActivity.java](https://github.com/OneButtonDeveloper/AndroidInfraRed/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/obd/infrared/sample/MainActivity.java)

## What's in the box? 


### Android Project - [Sample Application](https://github.com/OneButtonDeveloper/AndroidInfraRed/tree/master/app) 

The sample project gives you an idea how the infrared library is supposed to be used. The project contains an activity ([MainActivity.java](https://github.com/OneButtonDeveloper/AndroidInfraRed/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/obd/infrared/sample/MainActivity.java)) with a predefined layout ([activity_main.xml](AndroidInfraRed/app/src/main/res/layout/activity_main.xml)). The layout contains a console ([EditText](http://developer.android.com/intl/ru/reference/android/widget/EditText.html)) and a IR button. 

The _onCreate()_ method contains the full initialization of the [InfraRed](https://github.com/OneButtonDeveloper/AndroidInfraRed/blob/master/infrared/src/main/java/com/obd/infrared/InfraRed.java) library

When you run the application, the console will show you what is happening inside the library. When you click on the button, the IR blaster on your device will send a IR signal, of course only if your device is supported by the library. 

Please note that you wont get any runtime exceptions because your device is not supported.

Logging to a [EditText](http://developer.android.com/intl/ru/reference/android/widget/EditText.html) can be quite useful when you want to understand what's happening on your customer's devices. I often send special .apk files to users in order to obtain a log from their devices. 

 

### Android Library - [**Infrared**](https://github.com/OneButtonDeveloper/AndroidInfraRed/tree/master/infrared)

This library allows you to easily create raw IR signals in code, to detect device types and adapt raw signals for specific devices, to detect the devices' IR transmitters and to use them to send the adapted IR signals to a devices with a IR receiver. 

The [Library](https://github.com/OneButtonDeveloper/AndroidInfraRed/tree/master/infrared) consists of several packages that are explained below. 


#### [Logging package](https://github.com/OneButtonDeveloper/AndroidInfraRed/tree/master/infrared/src/main/java/com/obd/infrared/log)

Provides different ways to log data. All classes in this package inherit from the [Logger](AndroidInfraRed/infrared/src/main/java/com/obd/infrared/log/Logger.java) class.  

[LogToConsole](AndroidInfraRed/infrared/src/main/java/com/obd/infrared/log/LogToConsole.java) is useful when your can debug the application on a device that is connected to an IDE with LogCat. 

[LogToEditText](https://github.com/OneButtonDeveloper/AndroidInfraRed/blob/master/infrared/src/main/java/com/obd/infrared/log/LogToEditText.java) can be used to to display the log messages on the user's screen.

[LogToAir](https://github.com/OneButtonDeveloper/AndroidInfraRed/blob/master/infrared/src/main/java/com/obd/infrared/log/LogToAir.java) won't log anything (you can apply this in your application's release version)


#### [Pattern package](https://github.com/OneButtonDeveloper/AndroidInfraRed/tree/master/infrared/src/main/java/com/obd/infrared/patterns)

Enum [PatternType](https://github.com/OneButtonDeveloper/AndroidInfraRed/blob/master/infrared/src/main/java/com/obd/infrared/patterns/PatternType.java) tetermines the type of the IR signals in an integer array (a single value in the array is either the number of cycles or the time interval in microseconds).

The [PatternConverter](https://github.com/OneButtonDeveloper/AndroidInfraRed/blob/master/infrared/src/main/java/com/obd/infrared/patterns/PatternConverter.java) class allows you to convert patterns from one pattern type to another.  

The [PatternConverterUtils](https://github.com/OneButtonDeveloper/AndroidInfraRed/blob/master/infrared/src/main/java/com/obd/infrared/patterns/PatternConverterUtils.java) class can be used to create PatternConverter objects from strings containing a pattern in the DEC or HEX numeral system. 

[PatternAdapterType](https://github.com/OneButtonDeveloper/AndroidInfraRed/blob/master/infrared/src/main/java/com/obd/infrared/patterns/PatternAdapterType.java) enum contains values that are required to convert raw patterns. It also includes a method that determines which pattern type will be in use on the current device. It returns _ToIntervals_ by default, which will convert all raw patterns to time interval based patterns. 

The [PatternAdapter](https://github.com/OneButtonDeveloper/AndroidInfraRed/blob/master/infrared/src/main/java/com/obd/infrared/patterns/PatternAdapter.java) class will help you to adapt [PatternConverter](https://github.com/OneButtonDeveloper/AndroidInfraRed/blob/master/infrared/src/main/java/com/obd/infrared/patterns/PatternConverter.java) instances to [TransmitInfo](https://github.com/OneButtonDeveloper/AndroidInfraRed/blob/master/infrared/src/main/java/com/obd/infrared/transmit/TransmitInfo.java) objects according to the [PatternAdapterType](https://github.com/OneButtonDeveloper/AndroidInfraRed/blob/master/infrared/src/main/java/com/obd/infrared/patterns/PatternAdapterType.java) enum. 


#### [Detection package](https://github.com/OneButtonDeveloper/AndroidInfraRed/tree/master/infrared/src/main/java/com/obd/infrared/detection)

The [DeviceDetector](https://github.com/OneButtonDeveloper/AndroidInfraRed/blob/master/infrared/src/main/java/com/obd/infrared/detection/DeviceDetector.java) class is used to determine the manufacturer of the user's device by checking Android's Build.MANUFACTURER constant. This information is required in order to adapt the IR signals correctly. 

The [InfraRedDetector](https://github.com/OneButtonDeveloper/AndroidInfraRed/blob/master/infrared/src/main/java/com/obd/infrared/detection/InfraRedDetector.java) class checks if the devices has a built-in IR blaster. This procedure may vary depending on the IR Blaster, so there are a few different classes for this feature with a common interface named [IDetector](https://github.com/OneButtonDeveloper/AndroidInfraRed/blob/master/infrared/src/main/java/com/obd/infrared/detection/IDetector.java). Concrete implementations of the [IDetector](https://github.com/OneButtonDeveloper/AndroidInfraRed/blob/master/infrared/src/main/java/com/obd/infrared/detection/IDetector.java) can be found in the _["infrared/detection/concrete"](https://github.com/OneButtonDeveloper/AndroidInfraRed/tree/master/infrared/src/main/java/com/obd/infrared/detection/concrete)_ folder. 

[InfraRedDetector](https://github.com/OneButtonDeveloper/AndroidInfraRed/blob/master/infrared/src/main/java/com/obd/infrared/detection/InfraRedDetector.java) has a main function _detect()_ that verifies the availability of each initialized detector and returns corresponding [TransmitterType](https://github.com/OneButtonDeveloper/AndroidInfraRed/blob/master/infrared/src/main/java/com/obd/infrared/transmit/TransmitterType.java). The method returns _TransmitterType.Undefined_ if the device is not supported. 


#### [Transmit package](https://github.com/OneButtonDeveloper/AndroidInfraRed/tree/master/infrared/src/main/java/com/obd/infrared/transmit)

[TransmitterType](https://github.com/OneButtonDeveloper/AndroidInfraRed/blob/master/infrared/src/main/java/com/obd/infrared/transmit/TransmitterType.java) enum contains the supported transmitters which also includes the Undefined transmitter. 

The [TransmitInfo](https://github.com/OneButtonDeveloper/AndroidInfraRed/blob/master/infrared/src/main/java/com/obd/infrared/transmit/TransmitInfo.java) class contains the adapted IR signal data that will be send by the device's IR blaster. 

The [Transmitter](https://github.com/OneButtonDeveloper/AndroidInfraRed/blob/master/infrared/src/main/java/com/obd/infrared/transmit/Transmitter.java) class the is general interface type for all transmitters. Concrete implementations of them can be found in the _["infrared/transmit/concrete"](https://github.com/OneButtonDeveloper/AndroidInfraRed/tree/master/infrared/src/main/java/com/obd/infrared/transmit/concrete)_ folder. Each transmitter can implement _start()_ and _stop()_ methods and must have a transmit function that sends the pattern data with a [TransmitInfo](https://github.com/OneButtonDeveloper/AndroidInfraRed/blob/master/infrared/src/main/java/com/obd/infrared/transmit/TransmitInfo.java). 

A [Transmitter](https://github.com/OneButtonDeveloper/AndroidInfraRed/blob/master/infrared/src/main/java/com/obd/infrared/transmit/Transmitter.java) can initialize concrete transmitters based on the [TransmitterType](https://github.com/OneButtonDeveloper/AndroidInfraRed/blob/master/infrared/src/main/java/com/obd/infrared/transmit/TransmitterType.java). 


#### [InfraRed class](https://github.com/OneButtonDeveloper/AndroidInfraRed/blob/master/infrared/src/main/java/com/obd/infrared/InfraRed.java)

The [InfraRed](https://github.com/OneButtonDeveloper/AndroidInfraRed/blob/master/infrared/src/main/java/com/obd/infrared/InfraRed.java) class integrate packages functionality to easily use library. 

1. Create [InfraRed](https://github.com/OneButtonDeveloper/AndroidInfraRed/blob/master/infrared/src/main/java/com/obd/infrared/InfraRed.java) class
2. Call the _detect()_ method to get the [TransmitterType](https://github.com/OneButtonDeveloper/AndroidInfraRed/blob/master/infrared/src/main/java/com/obd/infrared/transmit/TransmitterType.java) 
3. Call the _createTransmitter()_ method to initialize a concrete transmitter  
4. Call the _start()_ method
5. Send different IR signals ([TransmitInfo](https://github.com/OneButtonDeveloper/AndroidInfraRed/blob/master/infrared/src/main/java/com/obd/infrared/transmit/TransmitInfo.java) objects) with the _transmit()_ function 

**!** Don't forget to call _stop()_ once you are done!
