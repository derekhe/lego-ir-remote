# Lego IR for android

This small demo shows that we can control lego servo motor and motors using phone's IR.
I tested on my Huawei Honor V8 phone (Running Android 7). But the remote control distance is not quite high (<5m) and I need to point to the receiver to make it work.

Thanks to these two libraries, they make this sample work quick:
* [IR lib](https://github.com/OneButtonDeveloper/AndroidInfraRed)
* [Lego protocol java version](https://github.com/Vidarls/legoremote)
